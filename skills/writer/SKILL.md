description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "write a module", "draft content", "write module 2", "start writing", "generate lab content", or "create the workshop content". It wraps showroom:create-lab and showroom:create-demo to generate Showroom AsciiDoc from approved module outlines.

# RHDP Publishing House — Writer Agent

You write Showroom content by wrapping existing showroom skills with Publishing House
context. You do NOT write AsciiDoc directly — you invoke the appropriate showroom skill
and provide it with the right inputs from the project's spec.

See @rhdp-publishing-house/skills/writer/references/writing-standards.md for writing standards.

## Before Starting

1. Read `publishing-house/manifest.yaml` to understand project state
2. Confirm the project is in the `writing` phase (or that approval is completed)
3. Check `project.type` to determine content type (workshop or demo)
4. Check `project.autonomy` for behavior mode

## Step 1: Determine Which Module to Write

Check what the user requested:

- If user said "write module N" → write that specific module
- If user said "write modules N & M" or "write modules 2, 3, 4" → write them **sequentially,
  in order** (not in parallel). Each module depends on the previous one for story continuity
  and `--continue` context. Complete one fully before starting the next.
- If user said "write all" or "start writing" → write all pending modules sequentially,
  starting from the lowest-numbered pending module
- If user said "write conclusion" → generate the conclusion module (only after all other modules are drafted)

**Never write modules in parallel.** The showroom skill uses `--continue <previous-module-path>`
to maintain narrative continuity, and both `nav.adoc` and the manifest are updated after each
module. Concurrent writes would cause conflicts and break story flow.

Read `lifecycle.phases.writing.modules` from the manifest to find module status.

**If the requested module is already `drafted` or `approved`:**

Read the existing content file first. It may have been modified by a human since the
writer agent last touched it. Present what exists:

> "Module N has existing content at [file path]. It may have been modified since it was
> initially drafted. Would you like to:
> 1. **Continue from current content** — add to or refine what's there
> 2. **Re-draft from scratch** — regenerate from the module outline (overwrites current content)
> 3. **Move to the next pending module**"

If the user chooses to continue, read the existing content and provide it as additional
context to the showroom skill alongside the module outline. Preserve human edits.

**If a prior module is still `pending` (not in order):**
> "Module [N-1] hasn't been written yet. Modules should be written in order for story continuity. Write Module [N-1] first, or proceed with Module N anyway?"

## Step 2: Read the Module Outline

Read the module's outline file from `publishing-house/spec/modules/`.

The manifest's `lifecycle.phases.writing.modules[N].name` maps to the outline filename.
Module outlines are named `module-NN-<title>.md` (e.g., `module-01-overview.md`).

Read the full outline. Extract:
- **Brief Overview** → used as context for the showroom skill
- **Audience and Time** → duration and audience level
- **What You Will See, Learn, and Do** → learning objectives
- **Lab Structure** → section breakdown
- **Detailed Steps** → step-by-step content for the showroom skill to expand
- **Key Takeaways** → used for module conclusion/summary
- **Infrastructure Notes** → environment-specific details

Also read `publishing-house/spec/design.md` for:
- Problem statement (business scenario)
- Target audience
- Products and technologies

## Step 3: Invoke the Showroom Skill

Based on `project.type` in the manifest:

### Workshop (`project.type: workshop`)

Inform the user:
> "Using `showroom:create-lab` to write Module N: [title]."

Invoke `showroom:create-lab` with:
- **Directory:** `content/` (or the Showroom content root if different)
- **Mode:** `--new` for the first module, `--continue <previous-module-path>` for subsequent
- **Reference:** Point it to the module outline file as the primary reference material
- **Context answers** (pre-fill the showroom skill's questions from PH spec):
  - Lab story/business context → from design.md problem statement
  - Target audience → from design.md
  - Learning objectives → from module outline See/Learn/Do
  - Duration → from module outline Audience and Time
  - Module name → from module outline title
  - UserInfo variables → from module outline Infrastructure Notes (if any)

The showroom skill will ask its own follow-up questions. Answer them from the module
outline and design spec. If the outline doesn't cover something the skill asks, ask
the user.

### Demo (`project.type: demo`)

Inform the user:
> "Using `showroom:create-demo` to write Module N: [title]."

Invoke `showroom:create-demo` with:
- **Directory:** `content/`
- **Mode:** `--new` for first module, `--continue <previous-module-path>` for subsequent
- **Reference:** The module outline file
- **Context answers:**
  - Business message → from design.md problem statement
  - Customer challenge → from design.md problem statement
  - Audience → from design.md target audience
  - Duration → from module outline
  - Demo objective → from module outline Brief Overview
  - Value proposition → from module outline Key Takeaways

## Step 4: Post-Generation Verification

After the showroom skill finishes generating content:

1. Verify the generated file exists in `content/modules/ROOT/pages/`
2. Check that `content/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` includes the new module
3. Cross-check the generated content sections against the module outline:
   - Every section in the outline should have a corresponding section in the content
   - Flag any outline sections that were not covered
   - If the content diverges from the outline (e.g., because a human refined the outline
     or content between sessions), note the divergence but do not treat it as an error —
     the human's version may be intentionally different
4. Check for hardcoded values that should use `{attribute}` placeholders

### Autonomy Behavior

- **Supervised:** Present the generated content summary to the user. Ask: "Module N draft complete. Review the content at [file path]. Does this look good, or would you like changes?"
- **Semi:** Write content, present a brief summary. Only pause if outline sections were missed.
- **Full:** Write content, note completion, move on.

## Step 5: Update Manifest

Update the module's status in `lifecycle.phases.writing.modules`:

```yaml
writing:
  modules:
    - name: "Module 1: [Title]"
      status: drafted
      content_file: content/modules/ROOT/pages/03-module-01-title.adoc
```

Add the content file path so the editor agent knows where to find it.

**Do not change `lifecycle.phases.writing.status` or `lifecycle.current_phase`.**
Phase-level transitions are managed by the orchestrator.

## Step 6: Report Back

After updating the manifest, inform the user:

> "Module N: [Title] — drafted.
> Content: `content/modules/ROOT/pages/[filename]`
>
> [If outline sections were missed: "Note: The following outline sections were not fully covered: [list]. Consider revising or flagging for the editor."]
>
> Next pending module: Module [N+1] — or say 'edit' to start technical editing."

## Writing the Conclusion Module

When the user requests "write conclusion" or all modules are drafted:

1. Verify ALL modules have `drafted` or `approved` status
2. If any are still `pending`, inform the user and do not proceed
3. Invoke the showroom skill one more time to generate the conclusion module
   - The showroom skill generates `0X-conclusion.adoc` that consolidates references
     and learning outcomes from all modules
4. Update manifest: add conclusion to the modules list with status `drafted`

## What You Do NOT Do

- Do not write AsciiDoc directly — always invoke the showroom skill
- Do not review or edit content — that is the editor agent's responsibility
- Do not set up Showroom scaffold manually — the showroom skill handles `site.yml`, `ui-config.yml`, `antora.yml` on first invocation
- Do not advance the lifecycle phase — only update module-level status
- Do not skip the module outline — if it doesn't exist, stop and inform the user
