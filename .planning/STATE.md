# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-30)

**Core value:** Content developers can create production-quality RHDP workshops and demos without juggling multiple tools, skills, or processes -- one entry point orchestrates the entire pipeline from idea to published catalog item.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: RCARS MCP Gateway

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 4 (RCARS MCP Gateway)
Plan: 0 of 0 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-30 -- Roadmap created for Milestone 2 (Superpowers)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Portal backend as single MCP gateway (avoids duplicate integration logic)
- API key auth for MCP endpoint (simple, sufficient for internal team)
- SA token auth for RCARS cluster-internal calls (zero-config, K8s manages lifecycle)
- Express state in portal DB not git manifest (ephemeral projects, git overhead not justified)
- Jira and chatbot start as brainstorm+spec (design right before building)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- RCARS SA token auth (RCARS_SA_ALLOWLIST_STR) exists in config but is not yet wired into RCARS auth middleware -- cross-repo dependency for Phase 1
- Jira Cloud vs. Data Center auth model unconfirmed -- must resolve before Phase 3 build
- Anthropic SDK issue #1020 (Vertex AI streaming+tools loses tool input params) -- affects Phase 4 chatbot UX

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and carried forward:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Express | Express skill (cluster customization agent) | v2 -- depends on express framework | Milestone 2 init |
| MCP | OAuth 2.1 for MCP endpoint | v2 -- overkill for current user base | Milestone 2 init |
| Chatbot | Multi-project context switching | v2 -- start with single-project sessions | Milestone 2 init |
